The code and the data used for training the model. The Keras framework (built on top of TensorFlow) is necessary to run the code and load the trained models. <br>
The training and testing data is available in waveformData. <br>
The code is available in training.py (with the pre-trained model being "FirstWorkingModel.keras" <br>
The trained model is available as "finalTrainedModel.keras"
